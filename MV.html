                <h6 style="width: 450px;">#1 Palette (feat. G-Dragon)</h6>
                <img src="https://channel-korea.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/iu-palette-1068x479.png" alt="palette" class="song1">
                <br/>
                <p>According to Billboard, “Palette,” released on Friday (April 21st), is the title track of her newly released fourth Korean album and is an autobiographical reflection of the songstress growing into herself as a 20-something with a nine-year-long career under her belt.</p>
                <p>Off-kilter percussion, thumping bass, saccharine synths, and electronic blips create a venue for IU’s muted, explorative millennial pop anthem, while BIGBANG’s G-Dragon joins in as a rapper offering sage advice and motivation to the younger musician.</p>
                <p>A sequel to 2015’s “Twenty-Three,” where she similarly addressed her burgeoning sexuality and adulthood, “Palette” showcases IU’s identity as a popular singer who rose to fame as a girlish teenager and is now ready to mature despite the ups and downs of her career. While in the former track IU sang about being a riddle-like woman in-between, this new single shows an artist filled with self-love and confidence: “I like it, I’m 25,” she sings in the chorus, later adding, “I got this.”</p>
                <p>After expressing herself while showing that she has both changed (she prefers dark purple over hot pink) and stayed the same (she still loves Corinne Bailey Rae), IU is joined by G-Dragon. The rapper offers up inspiration and words of wisdom to IU based on his own experience (“When I’m just me, I shine the brightest”) as he has already entered his 30s. (The song reflects Korea’s age system, where G-Dragon is 30 and IU is 25, even though internationally they are 28 and 23, respectively.) Almost as if breaking character, G-Dragon addresses IU by her given name “Jieun” rather than her stage name as if to redirect the listener’s attention to the fact that “Palette” is indeed the artist’s personalized message rather than just another typical, manufactured pop song.</p>
                <p>The music video for “Palette” furthers the song’s message, contrasting the IU of 2017 with her past self. To counter her former clean-cut image, “Palette’ shows the singer exploring her coming-of-age persona through a variety of styles including bright pink hair, boyish blazers, and a retro skirt suit, all of which sharply differ with a depiction of IU as her 18-year-old self performing her break-out 2010 hit, “Good Day.”</p>
                <p>As she continues to vacillate between adulthood and youth, the singer is seen playing with games and toys, kissing a statue, singing karaoke and dancing on her own, all while messages pop up on screen to reflect her anxieties and emotions: A street sign saying “don’t touch,” a colorful notebook with the words “every day happy” in bright hues, and a computer pop up asking, “Do you know this? Everyone hates you?” with the only options of choice being “I know” and “me too.” Though “Twenty-Three” was IU’s declaration of adulthood, “Palette” is the artist’s affirmation of self-confidence and a successful ode of coming into oneself.</p>
                <p>The reflective “Palette’ was co-written by IU and Lee Jong-hoon, while IU and G-Dragon wrote the lyrics. It’s one of two songs on Palette that the singer composed, along with “Can’t Love You Anymore.” IU also acted as the album’s primary lyricist. The ten-track Palette, released on April 21st, is IU’s first full-length album since 2013’s Modern Times.</p>

                <h6 style="width: 860px;">#2 Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossom (feat. HIGH4)</h6>
                <img src="https://channel-korea.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/maxresdefault-21.jpg" alt="spring" class="song2">
                <p>IU wrote the song, which was HIGH4’s debut song, and sings throughout it to provide the boy band with a feminine touch. Even though the members are rookies, HIGH4’s rougher vocals interspersed with IU’s voice showing the contrast between masculine and feminine voices and coming together to create a sweet, catchy song that is perfect for spring days.</p>
                <p>As the title suggests, this song is not about spring, love or cherry blossoms – the three most common subject matters of songs this season. Instead, it’s about a person — not in a relationship — who receives a sudden revelation when he/she looks around and sees that everyone is part of a couple. This person has no one to hold hands with and frankly, the love songs are a little bit too much for them.</p>

                <p>The MV for the title track of IU’s 2nd regular album, “You and I,” was produced by Hwang Soo-Ah.

                <p>IU explained, “Since I’m turning 20 in less than 3 weeks, I wanted to say to my future boyfriend to wait until then.”</p>

                <p>“Bbibbi” was released as a digital single on October 10th, 2018. “Bbibbi” is a laid-back alt-R&B track with confrontational and introspective lyrics that makes use of sound effects and onomatopoeia.</p>
                <p>The song was considered a “warning” to IU’s haters and critics, with her turning around commentary on her image. Particular attention was paid to her delivery, including phrases and words like “yellow C-A-R-D” and “hello stu-P-I-D.” “Bbibbi” refers to a pager in Korean, in particular, the noise the device makes before people leave a message. “Bbibbi” is also the Korean name of Pippi Longstocking, the titular character of the Swedish children’s novel Pippi Longstocking.</p>

                <p>IU wrote the lyrics and Sam Kim composed the song. The lyrics of this song seem to be from the perspective of someone talking to an older lover. They’re romantic, sad, and thoughtful all at the same time.</p>
                <p>The story behind this pays homage to the song’s English title: “Ending Scene,” with IU and Soo Hyun in a place that appears to be a cinema theater, laced with clouds and colorful string tied to each of their limbs as IU presses play on a movie. However, this is nothing like a movie date as they are watching back the memories of their relationship, skipping from their first meeting to multiple dates and also their first kiss.</p>
